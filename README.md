Remote Repositories
In order to collaborate on Git projects, you must interact with remote repositories, versions of a project residing online or on a network. You can work with multiple repositories, for which you can have read/write or read-only privileges. Teams can use remote repositories to push information to and pull data from.

Cloned Repositories
As mentioned earlier, for cloned repositories, Git will automatically give the name “origin” to the server from which you cloned and the name “master” to your local branch.

Seeing Your Remotes
By running the git remote command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.
